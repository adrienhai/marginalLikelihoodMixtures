# Marginal likelihood for mixture models

### Finite mixtures

The library bayesmixture.py gives all the functions used in order to compute the estimators of the marginal likelihood described in the article. Note that the only type of model currently supported is the normal mixture model with conjugate prior normal-inverse gamma. 
The table below gives a correspondance between the notation used for the hyperparameters in the article, and the one used in the code.
